# NetVault API Routes

## admin

## agents (NocVault Agents Phase 2 — hub control plane)
GET /api/agents/install.ps1 [public] [none] — PowerShell agent installer, hub origin baked in (resolveOrigin); public (remote runs `irm` pre-credential). Takes -Modules "span,ddi" and writes it into the agent's config.json `modules` — the agent loads modules from that file ONLY, so the hub's enrollment preset alone never reaches it (1.29.6)
GET /api/agents/bundle [public] [none] — agent bundle manifest {files:[]} walked from on-disk agent/ dir (excludes deps/state/keys/tests); 503 if unavailable; public
GET /api/agents/bundle/[...path] [public] [none] — serve ONE agent file's bytes; path-traversal confined to agent/ (403 escape, 404 missing/excluded); public
GET /api/agents/update-manifest [public] [none] — serve the committed, offline-signed self-update manifest {version,files:[{path,sha256}],sig} from agent/update-manifest.json; 503 if missing/unparseable (fresh install advertises no update); public (Phase 3 Workstream B)
DELETE /api/agents/[id] [auth] [db] — permanently delete a REVOKED agent (super_admin); 409 while not revoked (a live agent would re-provision itself); cascades agent_modules/health/commands and fans a 'forget' out to the satellites' loopback /api/internal/agents/forget so no orphan row is left
POST /api/agents/enroll-tokens [auth] [db] — mint one-time enrollment token + install one-liner (super_admin); the one-liner carries -Modules from the preset so the choice reaches the agent's config.json
POST /api/agents/enroll [public] [db] — token-authed (NO session): agent redeems token+host facts → agent_id, signed identity, module policy. Intentionally public write; NO checkWriteAllowed (token-gated infra); rate-limited 10 attempts/10min per source IP (lib/rateLimit.ts, in-memory fixed-window, fail-open) → 429 + Retry-After beyond that
POST /api/agents/[id]/heartbeat [agent-auth] [db] — agent-authed (requireAgentAuth, JWT sub must == [id]): liveness + health sample + 7d health prune; then RETURNS {ok:true, commands:[{id,type,args}]} — atomically claims this agent's status='pending' agent_commands (UPDATE…RETURNING → 'delivered'), carrying them back in the poll response exactly once (Phase 4a command channel)
POST /api/agents/[id]/commands [auth] [db] — enqueue a poll-carried command for the agent (super_admin); body {type} ∈ {restart,get_logs} (else 400), 404 if agent absent; INSERTs a pending agent_commands row → {id,type,status:'pending'}. Hub analog of SpanVault's sendToAgentId (no server→agent socket — delivered via the heartbeat response)
POST /api/agents/[id]/logs [agent-auth] [db] — agent-authed (requireAgentAuth, sub must == [id]): get_logs return path — body {lines:string[], command_id?}; stores agents.last_logs + last_logs_at, and if command_id given marks that agent_commands row status='done'. → {ok:true}
GET /api/agents/[id]/logs [auth] [db] — read the last log tail the agent returned (super_admin) → {lines, ts} (both null until the agent first answers a get_logs)
POST /api/agents/[id]/refresh [agent-auth] [db] — agent-authed (sub must == [id]): re-issue identity from CURRENT enabled modules, bump last_seen_at, return {jwt,expires_at}; revoked agent → 401 (stop). Default TTL 7d
GET /api/agents/[id]/policy [agent-auth] [db] — agent-authed (sub must == [id]): module assignment + config + data-plane ingest URLs
GET /api/agents [auth] [db] — fleet list, agents+site+modules+latest buffer_depth, derived status (super_admin)
GET /api/agents/[id] [auth] [db] — agent detail + last ~20 health rows (super_admin)
PATCH /api/agents/[id] [auth] [db] — update name/site_id + upsert/toggle modules (super_admin)
POST /api/agents/[id]/revoke [auth] [db] — set revoked_at, status='revoked' (super_admin); then best-effort fans out an active-kick to each covered app's data plane (Phase 3: SpanVault only, POST 127.0.0.1:3009/api/internal/agents/disconnect, non-fatal) so a LIVE session drops now, not just on next connect

## MFA (TOTP second factor, 1.33.0)
- `POST /api/auth/mfa/precheck` [public] [db] — login step 1. `{email,password}` → `{ok, mfaRequired?, enrolmentRequired?}`. Verifies the password before answering (so it cannot enumerate who has MFA) and rate-limited 20/5min per IP. GRANTS NOTHING — no session, token or cookie; authorize() re-checks password AND code independently, so skipping or faking this call gains nothing. It only decides whether the form shows a code field.
- `GET /api/mfa` [auth] [db] — current user's MFA state (enabled, enrolled_at, backup codes remaining, whether their role requires it).
- `POST /api/mfa` [auth] [db] — `{action:'setup'}` mints a secret + QR data URI but does NOT enable (a mis-scanned QR must not lock the user out); `{action:'enable',token}` verifies a code then enables and returns backup codes ONCE; `{action:'disable',password}` re-confirms the password (a hijacked session must not be able to silently remove the factor) and is refused when policy requires MFA for that role. Always acts on the SESSION's user id — never one from the body.
- `POST /api/admin/users/[id]/mfa-reset` [super_admin] [db] — clears a user's factor so they can re-enrol (lost phone + spent backup codes). This is an auth-bypass capability by design, so it is super_admin-only and written to `audit_log`.
